#Git & GitHub

A Git repository is a version-controlled project folder that tracks changes to files over time.

const app = express();
const port = 3000;
let color = "red";

return in function:
function rocketToMars() {
  return 'BOOM!';
}

const rocketToMars = function() {
  return 'BOOM!';
}

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found');

   var ReactCurrentActQueue = {
    current: null,
    // Used to reproduce behavior of `batchedUpdates` in legacy mode.
    isBatchingLegacy: false,
    didScheduleLegacyUpdate: false
  };
  let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
  res.json(user);
});
